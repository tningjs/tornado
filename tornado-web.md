## Design Valera

Hi Valera, nice to meet you! My name is Tao and I'm a Web developer. I'm planning to do a side project to create a desktop version of Clubhouse in the Browser and happen to see your design on Figma which is fantastic!

I was wondering could I hire you to make further work on it? If so, I'd like to start with the improvement of the home page and a new design of the room page. Here are my rough thoughts (open to discussion):

1. While the design should have a consistent user experience as mobile, it's even better to take the larger screen size and how users will interact with the App(keyboard and mouse) into consideration.

2. I would like the home screen to be 3 rail (similar to LinkedIn.com). In this way, the left and right rail can display more information, e.g. Trending topics, people/club to follow, and Ads.

3. I also like to have a design for the room page(when a user enters a room). On this page, I'd like to see some improvement to the current mobile experience: 1) make who is speaking/on stage more obvious. 2) Display the club information (it should have a follow button on the club information card). E.g: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX2TdLzWsq4 3) Click the avatar will display its profile on the same page (on mobile, it will navigate the user to the profile screen, but since the desktop has a larger screen size, it should be easier to view people's profile.

Do you think you can help? My contact is tning@linkedin.com | 848-247-3965. I'm looking forward to hearing from you soon.
